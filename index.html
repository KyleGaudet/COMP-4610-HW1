        <h1>Kyle's 2022 Patriots Predictions</h1>

        <!--Intro Paragraphs-->
        <p>
            One of the best things about September each year is the start of the NFL season. After a long spring and summer without any football it's time to spend 
            Sundays on the couch with family and friends watching games and eating some wings.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            This year there have been a lot of changes to the Patriots during the offseason such as the signing of DeVante Parker and other players, the addition of the
            new draft class, N'keal Harry being traded (finally), and also Joe Judge, Matt Patricia, and Bill Belickick all being involved in the offense. 
            Because of all these changes, as well as the changes to all the other teams around the league it will be interesting to see which teams are able to secure a 
            spot in the playoffs and if the Patriots will be one of the lucky few that do.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Below are my (mostly unbiased) win/loss predictions for this year's schedule.
        </p>

                <dd>For some reason the Patriots almost always find a way to lose when playing in Miami </dd>
            <dt>Packers:</dt>
                <dd>Aaron Rodgers</dd>
            <dt>Colts:</dt>
                <dd>Now that the Colts have moved on from 2-sprainz (aka Carson Wentz) they have a really complete
                    team that could be very good</dd>
            <dt>Cardinals:</dt>
                <dd>As long as there isn't a 2xp weekend on the new Call of Duty Kyler Murray should play well enough
                    to secure the win</dd>
            <dt>Bengals:</dt>
                <dd>They still have most of their Super Bowl roster and finally improved their offensive line</dd>
            <dt>Bills:</dt>
                <dd>The Bills are most people's Super Bowl favorites this year, Josh Allen and their elite defense will likely be 
                    enough to get them the win
                </dd>

        <!--closing paragraph-->
        <p>
            Obviously I'm not a football analyst so there's a decent chance that a lot of the above predictions are wrong, however I would say that I'm fairly 
            confident that the Patriots record will be around 11-6 for the season. With that record they would likely be able to get into the playoffs in the 
            wild card round, and if they do, hopefully it works out better than last years fairly disgusting 47-17 loss against the Bills.
        </p>
